How LLMs Understand Prompts
LLMs don't read like humans, they process sequences of mathematical tables to perdict the most probable next output based on patterns learned during training.

Key Mechanism:
tokenization and prediction: the text is broken into chunks the model calculates the satastical probability of next token in the sequence.
Context Window: the maximum amount of text(input prompt + generated output) the model can retain it's working memory.
Attention Mechanism: It allows the model to weight the importance of different works in the prompt 
Role and structure: able to give the role to ai,structure sequence

Components of a Strong Prompt

The Prompt Formula:
  the robust prompt isn't just a question -it is a programmed instruction  set.
  Combining these specific components significantly reduces ambiguity and guides a model to give exact output you need.Think of it as configuring software.

  Role/Persona:Assigns specific expertise and perspective and tone.
  Context:provides background info target audience and specific constraints to narrow those code.
  Free-Shot Examples:demonstrate input-output to teach the model design pattern and logic.
  Task:Defines the explicit objective and success criteria using strong actions withs.
  Input Data:the actual text  or data to process clearly seperated by demilers like quotes or brackets.
  Output Format:Specifies the exact structure, layout, or schema of the response (such as bullet points, table, JSON, headings, word limit, or step-by-step format) to ensure the output is usable and consistent.
  Gaudralis:Defines constraints, boundaries, and negative instructions that limit unwanted behavior, such as what to avoid, what not to include, safety rules, tone restrictions, or length limits.

__________
Tree of Thoughts(ToT):
A problem-solving framework where the model explores multiple reasoning parts,evaluates them, and backtracts to find the optimal solution.
phase1:Exploration and evaluation
Generate Candidate Thoughts:create multiple possible next steps or solutions for the current state.
Evaluate States:score or classify each candidate based on feasibility , constraints, or value.

phase2:Branching and selection    
Branch Promising Paths:expand only the high-scoring thoughts to generate the next 
Select Best Solutions:compare the completed paths and select the one with the highest aggregate score.
__________
Prompt Lifecycle
A systematic approach to developing reliable prompts,moving from intial defintion to production deployment.

phase1:
1.Define Goals & Metrics
2.Gather content
3.Draft baseline prompt
4.Test on Dataset
phase2:
5.Evaluate
6.Iterate systematically
7.Automate  & Chain
8.Deploy & Monitor
________
Zero-Shot Prompting:
Def:
Zero-shot prompting means giving a task to an AI without any examples. The model answers using only its pre-trained knowledge.
When to Use:
When the task is simple or common
When you don’t have example data
For quick responses or general questions
Input:
Translate the following sentence into French:
"I love learning AI."
Output:
J'aime apprendre l'IA.
___________
Few-shot Prompting:
Def:
Few-shot prompting means giving the AI a few examples before asking it to solve a similar task.
When to Use:
When the task is complex or specific
When you want better accuracy
When format or style is important
Input:
Translate English to French:

English: Hello
French: Bonjour

English: Thank you
French: Merci

English: I love learning AI
French:

Output:
J'aime apprendre l'IA.
________
Role-Based Prompting:
Def:
Assigning the specific role or persona to the AI (such as teacher, doctor, programmer, interviewer, storyteller, etc.) so it responds from that perspective, using relevant tone, knowledge, and behavior.
why it works:
🎯 Guides behavior – the AI knows how to think and respond
🧠 Improves accuracy by narrowing the context
🗣️ Controls tone & style (formal, friendly, technical, simple)
⚡ Reduces ambiguity and irrelevant answers
📚 Matches real-world expertise expectations
input:
Act as a machine learning teacher.
Explain overfitting in simple terms with an example.
output:
Overfitting happens when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.
For example, if a student memorizes answers instead of understanding concepts, they may fail a new exam. Similarly, an overfitted model fails on unseen data.
___________
Instruction Clarity and Formatting:
Mini-Example:
Summarize the following text in 3 bullet points.
Text: """Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries..."""

Be Explicit and Direct:
Clearly state what you want, how you want it, and any constraints (length, tone, format, depth).
Example:
Explain prompt engineering in simple language using 3 short points.

Use Delimiters:
Use symbols like """, ###, or --- to clearly separate instructions, input data, and context.
Example:
Summarize the text below:
---
Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence...
---


Specify Output Schema:
Define the exact format or structure of the response (JSON, table, bullets, headings, etc.).
Example:
Output format:
- Definition:
- Advantages:
- Example:

Negative Instruction:
Explicitly tell the model what NOT to do to avoid unwanted output.
Example:
Do not include code.
Do not exceed 100 words.
Do not use technical jargon
___________
ReAct:Reason+Act
def:
ReAct is a prompting technique where the model reasons step-by-step (Reason) and then takes an action (Act) such as answering, deciding, or calling a tool based on that reasoning.
why it's powerful:
  🧠 Encourages logical, step-by-step thinking
  🎯 Improves accuracy on complex tasks
  🔍 Makes decisions more transparent and explainable
  🔄 Combines thinking and doing in one workflow
  ⚡ Reduces random or incorrect responses
input:
  You are an AI assistant using the ReAct method.
  Reason step by step to solve the problem, then give the final answer.
  Question:
  If a store gives 20% discount on ₹1000, what is the final price?
output:
  Reason:
    20% of 1000 = 200
    Final price = 1000 − 200 = 800
  
  Act:
    The final price after discount is ₹800.
___________
Self-Consistency Decoding:
Core Definition:
  Self-consistency decoding is a technique where the model generates multiple reasoning paths for the same prompt and selects the most frequent or consistent final answer instead of relying on a single output.
ideal use cases:
  🧮 Mathematical problem solving
  🧠 Logical reasoning tasks
  📐 Multi-step decision making
  ❓ Ambiguous or complex questions
  📊 Exam-style reasoning problems
cost vs accuracy trade-off:
  💰 Higher computational cost because multiple outputs are generated
  🎯 Improved accuracy and reliability due to majority voting
  ⚖️ Best used when correctness is more important than speed or cost
Implementation Stratedy:
  Generate N independent responses using randomness (temperature > 0)
  Extract the final answer from each response
  Apply majority voting or clustering
  Return the most consistent answer
confidence scoring:
  Confidence can be estimated by:
    📈 Frequency of the chosen answer (e.g., 7 out of 10 outputs agree)
    🧠 Consistency across reasoning paths
    🔢 Higher agreement ⇒ higher confidence score
__________
Prompt Chaining & Pipelines:
def:Prompt chaining is a technique where a complex task is broken into multiple sequential prompts, with the output of one prompt serving as the input to the next, forming a structured pipeline.
phase1:structure and planning
  Decompose Task:
    Break a large or complex task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks that can be solved step by step.
    Example:
      Understand the problem
      Collect key points
      Create an outline
  Extract Facts:
    Identify and extract important facts, constraints, or data needed for the task.
    Example:
      Topic
      Target audience
      Word limit
      Key requirements
  Draft Plan/Outline:
    Create a clear plan or outline that defines what each later prompt should produce.
    Example:
      Introduction
      Main points
      Conclusion
phase2:Generation and Review
  Generate Deliverable:
    Use the planned structure to generate the main output (article, code, summary, report, etc.).
    Example:
      Write the full essay based on the outline
  verify & Refine:
    Review the generated output to check correctness, clarity, and completeness, then refine or correct errors.
    Example:
      Fix factual errors
      Improve clarity
      Reduce redundancy
________
