why prompt engineering matters:
Effective prompting bridges the gap between raw model capabilities and reliable bussiness application.

How LLMs Understand Prompts
LLMs don't read like humans, they process sequences of mathematical tables to perdict the most probable next output based on patterns learned during training.

Key Mechanism:
tokenization and prediction: the text is broken into chunks the model calculates the satastical probability of next token in the sequence.
Context Window: the maximum amount of text(input prompt + generated output) the model can retain it's working memory.
Attention Mechanism: It allows the model to weight the importance of different works in the prompt 
Role and structure: able to give the role to ai,structure sequence

Components of a Strong Prompt

The Prompt Formula:
the robust prompt isn't just a question -it is a programmed instruction  set.
Combining these specific components significantly reduces ambiguity and guides a model to give exact output you need.Think of it as configuring software.

Role/Persona:Assigns specific expertise and perspective and tone.
Context:provides background info target audience and specific constraints to narrow those code.
Free-Shot Examples:demonstrate input-output to teach the model design pattern and logic.
Task:Defines the explicit objective and success criteria using strong actions withs.
Input Data:the actual text  or data to process clearly seperated by demilers like quotes or brackets.
Output Format:
Gaudralis:

__________
Tree of Thoughts(ToT):
A problem-solving framework where the model explores multiple reasoning parts,evaluates them, and backtracts to find the optimal solution.
phase1:Exploration and evaluation
Generate Candidate Thoughts:create multiple possible next steps or solutions for the current state.
Evaluate States:score or classify each candidate based on feasibility , constraints, or value.

phase2:Branching and selection    
Branch Promising Paths:expand only the high-scoring thoughts to generate the next 
Select Best Solutions:compare the completed paths and select the one with the highest aggregate score.

__________
Prompt Lifecycle
A systematic approach to developing reliable prompts,moving from intial defintion to production deployment.

phase1:
1.Define Goals & Metrics
2.Gather content
3.Draft baseline prompt
4.Test on Dataset
phase2:
5.Evaluate
6.Iterate systematically
7.Automate  & Chain
8.Deploy & Monitor
